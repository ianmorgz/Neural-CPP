# NEURAL-CPP
Your go to, open-source, and lightweight library for compiling and building custom neural networks with C++. Neural-CPP provides the user full control over their networks, with a custom Tensor library allowing dor multiple initialization and activation functions, and simple easy to use set up. Neural-CPP also contains a virtual Dataset class, allowing the user to use this library on any data. 

## The Vision
My goal with Neurall-CPP is to optimize the training functions and interface, before expanding into a C library , where I can provide configuration to make neural networks as small and lightweight as possible, in order to run on microcontrollers. My goal is to be able to squeeze deep networks onto small systems, creating possibilities for endless innovation.

# Documentation
The following is the documentation for the library. Because of the continuous development of it, the documentation may not be up to date at any given moment but I will do my best to keep up with it.
